date: 2024-02-01
summary: Build a rich word bank using fun memory hooks and gentle repetition.
---

Vocabulary feeds every part of the 11+ — reading, comprehension, and reasoning. Instead of cramming, introduce a handful of new
words each week with clear mnemonics. Here are three favourites from the ElevenSpark word bank:

- **Meticulous** – picture a tick list; "met-TICK-you-lous" reminds pupils to check every detail.
- **Reluctant** – imagine a reluctant duck saying "quack later" when asked to move.
- **Sturdy** – think of a sturdy spade standing upright in the soil.

Use the spaced repetition mode in ElevenSpark for 10 minutes a day. Cards reappear just before they are forgotten, building
long-term recall without stress. Pair each word with a short sentence from daily life to anchor meaning.
