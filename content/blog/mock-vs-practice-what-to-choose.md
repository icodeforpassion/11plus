summary: Balance timed mocks with shorter practice bursts to reduce anxiety.

Timed mocks help learners rehearse stamina and pacing, but they can feel intense. Shorter practice sets focus on learning new
skills and building accuracy. A healthy weekly mix might look like:

- **Two quick practices** – 10 fresh questions each to reinforce weaker topics.
- **One vocab review** – keep the SRS queue tidy in under 10 minutes.
- **Optional mock** – only when the learner feels rested and curious.

Always review the worked solutions together. Celebrate thoughtful approaches, not just scores. Confidence grows when children see
progress in their strategy as well as their marks.
