title: 11+ Maths Fractions Made Easy
date: 2024-01-10
summary: Break down fraction skills into bite-sized strategies that build confidence.
---

Fractions appear in nearly every 11+ maths paper, yet the topic can feel slippery. At ElevenSpark we focus on repeatable
strategies:

1. **Rewrite the question** – encourage learners to say the problem aloud in their own words. This reduces panic.
2. **Find friendly numbers** – spotting common denominators makes addition and subtraction much simpler.
3. **Show working proudly** – part marks are awarded for method, and writing steps reinforces memory.

To practise, try 10-question quick sets with a mix of simplifying, comparing, and word problems about recipes or money. After each
attempt, review the worked solution. Confidence grows when pupils see *why* an answer works, not just the final figure.

Remember: we help families build sturdy maths habits; no service can guarantee a pass.
