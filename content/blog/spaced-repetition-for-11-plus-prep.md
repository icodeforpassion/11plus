The brain forgets on a curve. Spaced repetition (SRS) interrupts that curve by revisiting material just before it fades. In
ElevenSpark we use the SM-2 algorithm to set the next review interval based on how confident a learner felt about a card.

Benefits for families:

- **Less stress** – short reviews fit around clubs and family time.
- **Better recall** – words and maths facts move into long-term memory.
- **Clear signals** – the dashboard shows which topics are due so nothing piles up.

Encourage pupils to rate honestly: "That was easy" or "I need more practice". The algorithm adapts and ensures practice stays
manageable and confidence-led.
